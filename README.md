Hi everybody,\
this is a simple `README.md` file that you can use to test what it means to work in a decentralized team.

Feel free to change the lines you want... perhaps by testing what happens if you try to edit **the same line that someone else changed meanwhile** 😊

## Examples
Here are a few examples of source code just to fill space, and to show what Markdown syntax is capable of:

### Python code
```python
# lets uppercase my pets' names
my_pets = ['marion', 'red', 'tabitha', 'william']
uppered_pets = list(map(str.upper, my_pets))
print(uppered_pets)
```
Oh well, here I am.

### Something to do
- [ ] Shop fruit and vegetables
- [x] Love my cats 🐈 (you shouldn't miss it)
- [ ] Study 

### Math formulas
**Bitcoin halving formula**
```math
\sum_{i=0}^{32} 210,000 \times \frac{50}{2^i}
```
